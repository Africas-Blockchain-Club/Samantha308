About Lethukuthula Samantha Shabalala:

As a dedicated software development student at WeThinkCode_, I have developed a keen interest in blockchain technology. This repository is a personal initiative to document my exploration and growth within the blockchain space. My goal is to not only understand blockchain technology but to master the art of developing smart contracts.
Structure of My Repo:

This repository is organized into directories, each representing a different project. Starting from basic projects, I will incrementally take on more complex challenges to build a solid foundation in blockchain development. As a novice, my primary focus will be on smart contracts, and you will find a significant number of these in my repository. This journey is about continuous learning and development, and this repo will reflect my progress and commitment to becoming proficient in blockchain technology.
